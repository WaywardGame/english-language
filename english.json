The best casting method I have found using resources around me was sand casting.\"\n\n\"The primary ingredient for creating a sand cast is green sand, a mixture of clay flakes and refined sand. This allows for the malleability of creating the shape of tool and weapon heads, or even forming the ingots in which to work from.\"\n\n\"Next, we place the green sand in a flask, crafted with wood, sandstone, rock, or raw clay, finishing the build of the sand cast flask. We then set the shape, place down some talc powder so the finished produce can be lifted easier, and pour the molten smelted mixture into the cast to let it set and harden.\"\n\nThe book is adorned with crude drawings of each process.\n\n\"I have also found I can use limestone powder as the flux to refine ores and remove impurities in the smelting process.

Take for example your never-ending horizontal surrounding; the sea. It would be so easy if you were able to drink the salty brine, but even in a dire situation, it can often be deadly. It will cause distress to your insides and make you even thirstier. What type of gods found delight in such a thing?\"\n\n\"There is a workaround, however. Constructing a still will allow you to desalinate the water by distilling it. Boiling the water for long periods of time will cause the filtered steam to collect in a separate vessel, resulting in nearly pure water. Show those gods what for!\"\n\n\"Or perhaps you can find water on land. Water is commonly found in swampy areas and near rocks, especially in high elevation areas where snow may form. Snow is water after all! Water is also commonly abundant in subterranean caves. These forms of water may be safe to drink, but it's always a good idea to boil fresh water. This will require a fire source. Digging can also sometimes provide hidden underground water, especially near other bodies of pre-existing water like ponds and lakes.\"\n\n\"For the more industrious type, you may fancy a well. Wells will be able to accumulate rain and ground water, although not all terrain is suitable for their construction. Finding a ground water source may be taxing on resources, especially when you are not able to map any subterranean passages below.\"\n\n\"So you see, water is everywhere, you just need to know where to look.\"\n\nThe book ends with a signed name, \"Henry Cliffe\"."],

It appears that slashing damage causes them to multiply and split more commonly. You are best off with piercing damage as they are resistant to blunt damage. The more damage you do, the less chance they have to multiply.\"\n\n\"Another peculiarity I found when destroying these gelatinous gruesomes is that they can only split when there is room around them. Try killing them when they are cornered. They will be unable to proliferate!\"\n\n\"Slimes can sometimes act strangely and will merge into other slimes, creating a jelly cube. This is especially challenging if it is an aberrant jelly cube. Those things can certainly pack a punch and be fairly difficult to take down. It's good to keep them separated if you can.\"\n\n\"A sickening fact that I discovered awhile ago was that these cannibalistic cruelties will eat other slimes and jellies!

The accuracy of this readout will improve as your skill in Anatomy increases.\n\n{_Effectiveness_}\nIf a weapon has multiple damage types, it will use both of them on each hit. Each value in a resistance will reduce the damage by one, and each vulnerability will increase it by one. As an example:\n\nYou hit a scorpion with a wooden sword that deals 3 blunt/piercing damage. Scorpions have a resistance of 1 against piercing and a vulnerability of 2 against blunt with a base defense of 2.

I returned with the treasures in my sailboat, retracing my coordinates from the island to the village I once called my home. I'm not sure if it is \"home\" anymore.\n\nFortunately, the treasure that I had returned with has made me very wealthy indeed.\n\nEven so, something calls me back. Though my time on the island was survival; I survived. I thrived in fact. There's a yearning for excitement. There's a craving for more treasure. To exploit the island of its bounty at the expense of its anger.\n\nIs this part of the mystery and why nobody has heard of these places? All who that has heard of them never leave, and even those that do, always even up returning. I must go back. It is no longer an option.\n\nNobody ever truly leaves the island."],
			"bleeding": ["Bleeding", "{0?{0}:Using my bare hands to {1}} has caused me to begin bleeding. If I do not cease the flow of blood, my situation will quickly become much grimmer. I must stem the flow of blood using a bandage, tourniquet, or suture. I'm starting to feel a bit faint…"],
			"burned": ["Burned", "My seared flesh remains as painful as the moment I burned it. I know that while I am in this constant and unabating pain, my focus and wellbeing will be hampered. It may be wise to attempt to soothe this pain. Perhaps with pouring liquid over the burn, I can stifle the agony. It may be an even wiser idea to take a swim and use the minerals within the water to both sooth and heal the afflicted wound."],
			"caving": ["Caving", "When outside, I hear the chirps and calls of birds and small animals, and I hear the strong winds from the ocean rustle the leaves of trees and other fauna. Every once in a while, in the distance, I hear a loud growl or the sounds of a fevered chase through the underbrush, of a predator and its prey.\n\nDown here, however, is different story. It is eerily quiet in the depths of the island. And unlike above, the infrequent sounds that I {/do/} hear send shivers down my spine. A faint tip, tap, as water drips in the distance, a thin whistle as air passes through cracks in the rough stone. An intermittent clicking noise, of what I can only imagine must be the claws of a large arthropod.\n\nIt would be surprising if these caves didn't have {/something/} within them. There are other signs of human activity on this island, the caves should be no different. Maybe treasure or other riches. However, I would be lying to myself if I said I wasn't horrified at the thought of continuing deeper."],

The concept of {/\"fight or flight\"/} remains lingering in my mind. Perhaps running from {0} could be a consideration in the future. Attempting to tame or offer food to the creature has also crossed my mind.\n\nIf all else fails, I must protect my life through mortal conflict and dispatch of the creature. I will endeavor to record my findings on the effectiveness of my weapons against certain types of creatures. I note for example, that {0} is seemingly resistant to {1?{1}:no} damage types, and vulnerable to {2?{2}:no} damage types. This also applies to the potential damage the creature inflicts on me against my own armor.\n\nIn a previous situation, parrying proved to be very valuable, allowing me to block incoming attacks from my sparring partner. As long as I hold two weapons or a shield in my off-hand, I should be able to mitigate some damage from my opponent."],

The adage, {/\"violence is not the answer\"/} floods my mind as I ponder practicing benevolence against the creatures here.\n\nI could attempt to tame creatures using my skills; however, perhaps an even better idea would be to offer the creature food it would like to consume. Both options involve getting close to the creature. Perhaps I can simply leave the items on the ground and see if they will act in kindness towards me after accepting my offering as they move towards it. I know I will become more successful with any of these options as my skills grow."],
			"dehydration": ["Dehydration", "The rhyme echoes in my head, {/\"water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink\"/}. My mind runs cloudy; my mouth bone-dry. I'll require water if I am to last any longer.\n\nUnfortunately, the largest body of water in my vision is nearly undrinkable in its natural form. I'll need to construct a water still if I am to convert the salinated sea water to potable water. It is quite the endeavor indeed.\n\nIf I am lucky, I may be able to find fresh water sources inland or in the caves below.

I think with repeated attempts, I'll gain some knowledge to hopefully succeed in crafting {0} eventually. I also hope that the materials can suffer the wear that my poor crafting skills are placing on them. I may even need to replace some components that I am damaging on each attempt.\n\nAlthough I have many ideas on what to craft with the items in my inventory, some of them may be quite difficult to craft without first having an intermediate, advanced or even expert skill level in the craft for each item."],
			"gardening": ["Gardening", "As I work on {0}, I reflect on the growth stages of vegetation that I have witnessed. Most plants seem to begin producing the most valuable resources at around the flowering stage, but I have observed the most bountiful haul comes during the ripening stage, when the fruits and vegetables are ripe for the taking and the seeds are available to gather.\n\nIf I want to succeed at gardening, I may also need to consider trying my hand at crafting fertilizer and fertile soil for my garden. I mustn't also forget to water my plants. Watering them will surely help them grow and survive long enough to produce the resources which seem all too dire in my situation."],

They seemed friendly enough and offered to trade items they had found with me.\n\nMy skill in bartering may pay off when deciding on a trade value, which we have signified with a credit system. {0} gives me credit when I give items to them, and reversely, removes credits when I find an item in their inventory worth taking for myself.\n\nEven though I found this valuable trading partner, the thought of something more nefarious has crossed my mind. Taking their supply by force would likely put me at odds with the island, but it may be worth it for their belongings and equipment."],

			"poisoned": ["Poisoned", "My vision blurs as I write this; my stomach tied in knots. {0} has caused me to become poisoned. I can feel myself getting weaker even through the process of writing this note. Thirst consumes me, and my wellbeing is in jeopardy. I must attempt to fabricate a cure. Perhaps plants of a medicinal nature may aid me in this bodily turmoil."],
			"reputation": ["Reputation", "It seems that as time passes and the struggle for survival continues, the actions I take which are averse to the benefit of the island come back to haunt me.\n\nWhen I sow plants, or respect the island's inhabitants, less of them seem to be hostile. Likewise, when I gather resources, deface the landscape, or attack creatures, I see malicious beasts much more frequently.\n\nAs of writing this, it seems as though the island is {0?{#--COLOR-GOOD:benign}:{#--COLOR-BAD:malign}}. For the benefit of my survival, I may want to limit the scope of my damage to the natural environment."],
			"seaTravel": ["Sea Travel", "I finally made it!\n\n{0?My {0} chopped through the rough seas on my journey to this new set of islands.:Although, I felt like I barely made it at all, traveling these seas without a boat was very foolish in hindsight, exhausting me to my very core, and nearly killing me in the process.} {1?{2?Using my {1} and {2}, I was able to significantly speed up my journey, reducing the food and water needed for the voyage.:Using my {1}, I was able to save some time on my journey, but it would have been even faster with {3}, reducing the food and water required even further.}:If I had a sextant and a spyglass, I could have significantly reduced the time needed for the voyage, saving much food and water for the trip. It was difficult navigating the seas without them.}"],
			"staminaReplenishment": ["Stamina Replenishment", "My breath is fast and heavy. I'm nearly worked to the point of exhaustion. I should proceed to slow my work to a bare minimum while my stamina replenishes itself. More efficiently, I could try resting on the ground, or even sleep in a bedroll for maximum benefits. Rest is important for my sanity and my survival."],
			"starvation": ["Starvation", "I'm wasting away. Each step I take feels like a step closer to death, and each one of those steps makes me weaker and weaker.\n\nI would eat anything in this state. Yes, even all the undesirables I have passed on throughout my life. I'll take the vile organs from a rat, I'll take the bitter seeds from a tree, and I'll even eat any creepy crawlies I discover. Anything for a little sustenance on this blasted island.\n\nIt might be a good idea to search further out or even think about planting my own crops. I don't know how long I'll be here for. If my hunger is anything to go by, it might not be for much longer."],
			"stranded": ["Stranded", "I awake to find myself no longer in the company of good men or a fine seafaring vessel. Instead I discover myself in tattered clothing, with but a few possessions: {0}, and other shoddy items.\n\nTreasure... The thought is vague and fleeting, but... I remember something about treasure."],
			"toolUse": ["Tool Use", "I'm reminded of the proverb, {/\"the right tool for the right job\"/} as I attempt to {0} using my bare hands. I know that using a tool for {1} would reduce my change of injury as well as provide much needed efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, I've observed the increased efficiency of using a bladed tool while lumberjacking and using a blunt tool while mining. The proverb proves its innate truth."],
			"treasureHunting": ["Treasure Hunting", "I have happened upon a tattered map and on closer inspection of the drawings, appears to be a marked location. It may take several attempts to decode the map and find the location based on my surroundings, but I believe I should investigate this further. As my skill in cartography improves, I'm sure I will be able to make more of the drawings out. This could very well be a treasure map.\n\nAlthough my memory is fleeting, I do recall my penchant for treasure."]
