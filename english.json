This allows for the malleability of creating the shape of tool and weapon heads.\n\nNext, we place the green sand in a flask, crafted with wood, sandstone, granite, or raw clay, finishing the build of the sand cast flask. We then set the shape, place down some talc powder so the finished produce can be lifted easier, and pour the molten smelted mixture into the cast to let it set and harden.\n\n{#--TEXT-SECONDARY:{/The book is adorned with crude drawings of each process./}}\n\nI have also found I can use limestone powder as the flux to refine ores and remove impurities in the smelting process.

Take for example your never-ending horizontal surrounding; the sea. It would be so easy if you were able to drink the salty brine, but even in a dire situation, it can often be deadly. It will cause distress to your insides and make you even thirstier. What type of gods found delight in such a thing?\n\nThere is a workaround, however. Constructing a still will allow you to desalinate the water by distilling it. Boiling the water for long periods of time will cause the filtered steam to collect in a separate vessel, resulting in nearly pure water. Show those gods what for!\n\nOr perhaps you can find water on land. Water is commonly found in swampy areas and near rocks, especially in high elevation areas where snow may form. Snow is water after all! Water is also commonly abundant in subterranean caves. These forms of water may be safe to drink, but it's always a good idea to boil fresh water. This will require a fire source. Digging can also sometimes provide hidden underground water, especially near other bodies of pre-existing water like ponds and lakes.\n\nFor the more industrious type, you may fancy a well. Wells will be able to accumulate rain and ground water, although not all terrain is suitable for their construction. Finding a ground water source may be taxing on resources, especially when you are not able to map any subterranean passages below.\n\nSo you see, water is everywhere, you just need to know where to look.\n\n{#--TEXT-SECONDARY:{/The book ends with a signed name:/}}\n\n- Henry Cliffe"],

It appears that slashing damage causes them to multiply and split more commonly. You are best off with piercing damage as they are resistant to blunt damage. The more damage you do, the less chance they have to multiply.\n\nAnother peculiarity I found when destroying these gelatinous gruesomes is that they can only split when there is room around them. Try killing them when they are cornered. They will be unable to proliferate!\n\nSlimes can sometimes act strangely and will merge into other slimes, creating a jelly cube. This is especially challenging if it is an aberrant jelly cube. Those things can certainly pack a punch and be fairly difficult to take down. It's good to keep them separated if you can.\n\nA sickening fact that I discovered awhile ago was that these cannibalistic cruelties will eat other slimes and jellies!

They offer a place for people to gather and engage in discussions, exchange ideas, and connect with others who share similar interests.\n\nOverall, the importance of the written word and libraries for civilization cannot be overstated.

James referred to them as \"abnormals\", while Joseph named them \"aberrants\". We aren't sure which to go with yet.\n\nWe have kept some as livestock. A goat, then a chicken, then a rabbit. They all grew from their original size, but not in the same way that something grows old. This was different. The stranger thing yet is that they mirrored our party's attributes. It took many months to discover this, and we still aren't completely convinced of our findings. But they are as such:\n\nAs we trained our sword-fighting, or slayed other beasts here, raising our combat tactics, these abnormal creatures became more robust, sturdy, and less likely to injure; their defensive capabilities doubled.\n\nAs we trained our own defense skills through parrying and blocking incoming attacks, it made them seem more aggressive and able to pack a stronger punch, so to speak. Albert can attest to this after getting rammed by the goat on two separate occasions with unworldly vigor.\n\nAs we hew stone, fell trees, and as our strength increased, so did their vitality and healthfulness. We witnessed the rabbit get a deep cut and bleed what seemed like liters of blood only to be fine the next day.\n\nIf I had to make a guess, I think this has to do with the strange nature of this island. It is the feeling we all feel. It's almost as if the trees have eyes here, watching our every movement. The rocks speak with wide sharp mouths telling us to leave.

That feeling was intensified throughout the cold and struggle-filled night.\n\nAs I survived throughout the days, I soon learned that this place was not just a forsaken archipelago; it was alive, and not just with strange creatures, but with three enigmatic spirits all connected to the island. I discovered these spirits through symbols marked on runes I found as I crafted, built, and survived.\n\nThe first spirit, that I came to know as \"Da\", and depicted as {$DEITY:EVIL}, a symbol whose shape appears to be a twisted and corrupted horned beast. They were the restless nights, the sprained ankle, and the giant rats always nipping at my heels.\n\nThe second spirit, that I came to know as \"Wry\", and depicted as {$DEITY:CHAOS}, a symbol representing multiple branched paths leading to nowhere and possibly everywhere. They were the ambivalence of nature itself, the chaotic dance of heated combat, or whether this berry was safe to eat.\n\nThe third and final spirit, that I came to know as \"Aw\", and depicted as {$DEITY:GOOD}, a symbol that recollects feelings of a soft hug, a safe aura, or a delicate ring imbued with peace. They were the good on this island, as little of it as there was.\n\nI learned I could control certain aspects of the island by invoking these spirits through the runes. Through some found texts, I eventually discovered that I could sacrifice these runes at an altar to transform these runes into more pure and potent forms. Luckily, I was able to fashion my own altar and luckily the spirits accepted it as a place of invocation.\n\nThese were not simple spirits after all; these were deities."],

This also applies to the caves below.\n\nAs you travel to different islands, the territories will invert in shape and will increase in difficulty as you get to the center of the island instead.

			"backToCivilization": ["To Civilization and Back", "Having found all the treasures, I found I could finally leave the islands. I did so, returning with them secured in my sailboat, retracing my coordinates back to the village I once called my home.\n\nFor a time, I was happy. The treasure I had returned with had made me very wealthy; I had everything I could ever ask for. It did not last. It was monotonous. \n\nI could not call the village \"home\" anymore.\n\nAnd so, the islands called me back. Though my time here was a struggle, I survived. I thrived, in fact. Even now, within me is a yearning for excitement. A craving for more treasure. To exploit the islands of their bounties, at the expense of their fury.\n\nCould this be part of the mystery; why no one has heard of these places? The islands' inhabitants never leave, and even those that do... always return in the end. I was the same. It was no longer an option.\n\nIn the end, nobody ever truly leaves the islands."],
			"bleeding": ["A Dangerous Mistake", "{0?{0}:Using my bare hands to {1}} has cut me. If I do not patch the wound, my situation could quickly become much grimmer. Multiple cuts could cause more significant bleeding. I must stem the flow of blood using a bandage, tourniquet, or suture. I'm starting to feel a bit faint…"],
			"burned": ["Fire Can Never Be Tamed", "My seared flesh remains as painful as the moment I burned it. I know that while I am in this constant and unabating pain, my focus and wellbeing will be hampered. It may be wise to attempt to soothe this pain. Perhaps with pouring liquid over the burn, I can stifle the agony. It may be an even wiser idea to take a swim and use the minerals within the water to both sooth and heal the afflicted wound."],
			"caving": ["The Depths of the Island", "When outside, I hear the chirps and calls of birds and small animals, and I hear the strong winds from the ocean rustle the leaves of trees and other flora. Every once in a while, in the distance, I hear a loud growl or the sounds of a fevered chase through the underbrush, of a predator and its prey.\n\nDown here, however, is different story. It is eerily quiet in the depths of the island. And unlike above, the infrequent sounds that I {/do/} hear send shivers down my spine. A faint tip, tap, as water drips in the distance, a thin whistle as air passes through cracks in the rough stone. An intermittent clicking noise, of what I can only imagine must be the claws of a large arthropod.\n\nIt would be surprising if these caves didn't have {/something/} within them. There are other signs of human activity on this island, the caves should be no different. Maybe treasure or other riches. However, I would be lying to myself if I said I wasn't horrified at the thought of continuing deeper."],
			"combat": ["Fight or Flight", "As I engage in combat with {0}, I acknowledge it may not be the best course of actions, given my current situation. The concept of {/\"fight or flight\"/} remains lingering in my mind. Perhaps running from {0} could be a consideration in the future. Attempting to tame or offer food to the creature has also crossed my mind.\n\nIf all else fails, I must protect my life through mortal conflict and dispatch of the creature. I will endeavor to record my findings on the effectiveness of my weapons against certain types of creatures. I note for example, that {0} is seemingly resistant to {1?{1}:no} damage types, and vulnerable to {2?{2}:no} damage types. This also applies to the potential damage the creature inflicts on me against my own armor.\n\nIn a previous situation, parrying proved to be very valuable, allowing me to block incoming attacks from my sparring partner. As long as I hold two weapons or a shield in my off hand, I should be able to mitigate some damage from my opponent."],
			"corpse": ["Survival of the Fittest", "{0} {1?lay:lays} there, lifeless. In order to maintain my own life, perhaps it would be beneficial to use a sharp tool or material to butcher {1?these:this} {1?corpses:corpse} and gather the usable remains."],
			"creatureTaming": ["What Have I Done", "I recall a more innocent time in my life as I witness the deceased {0}. The adage, {/\"violence is not the answer\"/} floods my mind as I ponder practicing benevolence against the creatures here.\n\nI could attempt to tame creatures using my skills; however, perhaps an even better idea would be to offer the creature food it would like to consume. Both options involve getting close to the creature. Perhaps I can simply leave the items on the ground and see if they will act in kindness towards me after accepting my offering as they move towards it. I know I will become more successful with any of these options as my skills grow."],
			"dehydration": ["Water, Water, Everywhere, nor Any Drop to Drink", "The rhyme echoes in my head. {/Water, water.../} My mind runs cloudy; my mouth bone-dry. I'll require such if I am to last any longer.\n\nUnfortunately, the largest body of water in my vision is nearly undrinkable in its natural form. I'll need to construct a water still if I am to convert the salinated sea water to potable water... too much of an endeavor in my current state.\n\nIf I am lucky, I may be able to find fresh water sources inland or in the caves below. It should be drinkable in its natural form, but erring on the side of caution, it may be prudent to boil it for safety."],
			"durability": ["Nothing Lasts Forever", "My {0} is close to breaking from use. {1?Using my {1}, I should be able to repair it easily enough:With the right resources, I should be able to fashion myself a hammer to repair it}.\n\nIf I actively search out high quality materials to craft my tools, armor, and weapons with, I can expect much higher durability on them, especially after my skills have improved. {2?I can also craft glue to:If I ever manage to find out how to concoct a glue, I can} further reinforce my items, providing much higher durability."],
			"encumbered": ["Why Must I Be So Weak", "This confounded burden! My pack is overflowing with heavy items that I will need to purge in order to decrease my encumbrance. Carrying this many items will slow down my movement and heavily impact my stamina.\n\nSome of the heaviest things in my inventory include {0}, {1}, and {2}."],
			"failureInCrafting": ["I Am Too Inexperienced", "I failed in my attempt to craft {0}, mostly due to my lack of skill and knowledge in {1}. I believe that with repeated attempts, I will gain more of that skill and knowledge, and, eventually, succeed. I also hope that the materials can suffer the wear that my poor crafting skills are placing on them. I may even need to replace some components that I am damaging on each attempt.\n\nAlthough I have many ideas on what to craft with the items in my inventory, some of them may be quite difficult to craft without first having an intermediate, advanced or even expert skill level in the craft for each item."],
			"gardening": ["Gardening", "As I work on {0}, I reflect on the growth stages of vegetation that I have witnessed. Most plants seem to begin producing the most valuable resources at around the flowering stage, but I have observed the most bountiful haul comes during the ripening stage, when the fruits and vegetables are ripe for the taking and the seeds are available to harvest.\n\nIf I want to succeed at gardening, I may also need to consider trying my hand at crafting fertilizer and fertile soil for my garden. The quality of terrain in which I plant the seed or mushroom will likely impact its growth as well. I mustn't also forget to water my plants. Watering them will surely help them grow and survive long enough to produce the resources which seem all too dire in my situation."],
			"healthIssues": ["Is This the End?", "My wellbeing is at an all-time low. I'm bruised, battered, and nearly defeated. My only chance at a respite is through medical intervention, rest, healthy foods, or ideally, all three.\n\n{0?As much as it pains me to consider it, disassembling my clothing to craft makeshift bandages appears to be a good option in my current predicament.}{1?Luckily, I do have some items to be used for healing within my inventory including {1}.}"],
			"inedible": ["That... Was Inedible", "Consuming {0} may not have been the best of ideas. I {1?think I may:am probably lucky not to} have been poisoned by it... It would be prudent to pay better attention to what I ingest. Something like that should only be consumed when I am in dire straits."],
			"itemQualities": ["Extraordinary!", "As I pick up {0}, I notice it is {Misc:ColorizeQuality:({1},{ARTICLE:{2} specimen})} indeed. I'm sure using this in a craft will benefit the end result greatly. I also observe it appears to have greater durability and strength than most other items in its class, resulting in much greater endurance when used."],
			"mercantile": ["A Friendly Face", "I meet {0} today, a person in a similar state as myself; surviving on this island and living off the land. They seemed friendly enough and offered to trade items they had found with me.\n\nMy skill in bartering may pay off when deciding on a trade value, which we have signified with a credit system. {0} gives me credit when I give items to them, and reversely, removes credits when I find an item in their inventory worth taking for myself.\n\nEven though I found this valuable trading partner, the thought of something more nefarious has crossed my mind. Taking their supply by force would likely put me at odds with the island, but it may be worth it for their belongings and equipment."],
			"nightfall": ["Nightfall", "Dusk is quickly approaching. Who could know what creatures lurk in the darkness — it would be wise to seek shelter or make a camp for the night."],
			"poisoned": ["Poisoned", "My vision blurs as I write this; my stomach tied in knots. {0} has caused me to become poisoned. I can feel myself getting weaker even through the process of writing this note. Thirst consumes me, and my wellbeing is in jeopardy. I must attempt to fabricate a cure. Perhaps plants of a medicinal nature may aid me in this bodily turmoil."],
			"rune": ["Artifacts of Unknown Origin", "I seem to have come into the possession of {0}. However, I do not know how I obtained it. I {1??performed an action}, and then it was there, amongst the rest of my things. Or... maybe it was always there?\n\nAdmittedly, I do not understand this artifact, either. It seems to have a symbol carved into it, one I do not recognise from my earlier travels. It is only a theory, but perhaps long ago, people used these as a way to commune with the deities they believed in.\n\nLogically, at the moment, such an item should not be useful, but... I think I might hold onto it anyway. Something tells me that it may have more \nimportance than it seems."],
			"seaTravel": ["Another Voyage Ends", "I finally made it!\n\n{0?My {0} chopped through the rough seas on my journey to this new set of islands.:All of the time I have practiced swimming has allowed me to travel to an entirely new set of islands.} {1>0?{2=0?Using {1...}, I was able to significantly speed up my journey, reducing the food and water needed for the voyage.:Using {1...}, I was able to save some time on my journey, but it would have been even faster with {2...}, reducing the food and water required even further.}:If I had {2...}, I could have significantly reduced the time needed for the voyage, saving much food and water for the trip. It was difficult navigating the seas without them.}"],
			"staminaReplenishment": ["My Needs Outpace My Stamina", "My breath is fast and heavy. I have worked nearly to the point of exhaustion. I should slow my work to a bare minimum while I regain my stamina. More efficiently, I could try resting on the ground, or even sleep in a bedroll for maximum benefits. Rest is important for my sanity and my survival."],
			"starvation": ["Wasting Away", "Each step I take feels like a step closer to death, and each one of those steps makes me weaker and weaker.\n\nI would eat anything in this state. Yes, even all the undesirables I have passed on throughout my life. I'll take the vile organs from a rat, I'll take the bitter seeds from a tree, and I'll even eat any creepy crawlies I discover. Anything for a little sustenance on this blasted island.\n\nIt might be a good idea to search further out or even think about planting my own crops. I don't know how long I'll be here for. If my hunger is anything to go by, it might not be for much longer."],
			"stranded": ["Stranded", "I awake to find myself no longer in the company of good men or a fine seafaring vessel. Instead I discover myself in tattered clothing, with but a few possessions: {0}, and other shoddy items.\n\nTreasure... The thought is vague and fleeting, but... I remember something about treasure."],
			"toolUse": ["The Right Tool for the Right Job", "This is the proverb I am reminded of, as I attempt to {0} using my bare hands. I know that using a tool for {1} would reduce my change of injury as well as provide much needed efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, I've observed the increased efficiency of using a bladed tool while lumberjacking and using a blunt tool while mining. The proverb proves its innate truth."],
			"treasureHunting": ["Treasure!", "I have happened upon a tattered map and on closer inspection of the drawings, appears to be a marked location. It may take some time to find the location based on my surroundings, but I believe I should investigate this further. As my skill in cartography improves, I'm sure I will be able to make more of the drawings out. This could very well be a treasure map.\n\nAlthough my memory is fleeting, I do recall my penchant for treasure."]
